          <p>
            Here's why I'm offering this -<br />
            <br />
            I have seen the power of automating your business workflows. Take
            some time out of your busy schedule today and see what all things
            can be automated in your workflows.
            <br />
            <br />
            You will find that most of your time is going in doing things that
            could be done better by automating. You just have to give it a shot!
            <br />
            <br />
            Start with automating small workflow and then gradually you will
            love it!!
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you, and I hope we'll get the opportunity to be a part of your
            growth journey soon!
